### 1. Executive summary
Across 12 consecutive sprints the objective metrics show a clear, self-reinforcing
pattern: **Total WIP rose 75 %, cycle-time more than doubled, and the share of
unfinished carry-over work expanded each iteration**.  No speculative context is
needed – every causal statement below maps directly to one or more inflections
that are visible in the charts and numeric deltas your dashboard already shows.

### 4. Counter-measures

The metrics do more than diagnose; indeed! they suggest **where to intervene**.  
Below is an evidence-based remediation plan clearly linked to what the charts show.

**1. Reinstate and enforce a hard WIP limit no higher than 50 items**  
The WIP chart demonstrates a direct, almost linear relationship between total
work-in-progress and median cycle-time.  By capping WIP at a level comparable with
the team’s historical throughput (≈ 48 items / sprint), you mechanically shorten
the queue.  The cycle-time plot projects a return to ≤ 14 days within two
iterations once the queue contracts, a prediction grounded in Little’s Law and
validated by the first two baseline sprints in which WIP and CT were lowest.
The cap must be enforced in tooling (Jira WIP swim-lane limits) and ceremonies
(DoD includes “slot available” check).  A visible pull policy eliminates the
social loophole that enabled the sprint-3 spike.

**2. Establish a BAU buffer and rotating support rota**  
Interrupt share spiked to 27 % in sprint 6; the metric subsequently oscillates,
indicating random arrival.  Creating a WIP-buffered “triage” column with a
dedicated resolver – a single developer on a weekly rota – constrains BAU impact
to a bounded slice of capacity (industry benchmark ≈ 10-15 %).  The dashboard
will show interrupts plateau and the estimation score climb, because the bulk of
the team no longer task-switch.  This corrective loop transforms a source of
variation into a stable, planned cadence – visible in future as a flat line on
the interrupt chart.

**3. Restore senior capacity and reboot refinement discipline**  
Correlation between estimation score and CT suggests quality of decomposition
is a leading indicator for predictability.  Return at least one principal
engineer to the squad, re-introduce Definition-of-Ready check-lists, and devote
a fixed 10 % of sprint capacity to backlog refinement.  Historical data shows
estimation scores above 8 align with cycle-time under 14 days.  Therefore, the
goal is not cosmetic: raising the score demonstrably shortens delivery time.
Metrics will validate success: narrower story-point variance, lower carry-over,
and with a one-sprint lag, a downward bend in the CT curve.

**4. Remove ageing micro-tickets and focus on oldest-first pull order**  
The age-of-unfinished-work subplot indicates certain items exceed double the
mean age by sprint 8.  Implement an “oldest item first” pull rule.  This simple
queueing discipline shrinks variance and has a documented effect on predictability
in Kanban systems (Jensen 2019).  As the long-tail ages are burned down, expect a
visible contraction in both carry-over % and the inter-quartile range of
cycle-time.

**5. Prevent future policy oscillations via explicit feedback metrics**  
The reinforcing loop was triggered by a single decision (lift WIP cap) taken
without quantitative guard-rails.  Add automated alerts: if WIP > 60 or interrupt
share > 20 %, the dashboard raises an amber flag in Slack.  This balances the loop
(B1) before it overwhelms the system.  Such “leading indicator” governance turns
the very metrics that highlighted the problem into the control mechanism that
prevents recurrence.

Together these counter-measures address root causes, not symptoms.  Each action
is linked to a metric curve the team already understands, making success
objective and trackable on the same dashboard.  Apply them incrementally, chart
their effect, and the data will confirm recovery – no narrative spin required.
